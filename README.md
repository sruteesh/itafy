Nowadays, there is an increment on the need of real-time data. As a result of his policy of allowing access to the large majority of its content, Twitter is a social network widely used to obtain real-time information.

This project aims to extract and to analyze information accessible via Twitter, as well as to research on the existing opportunities for its processing and subsequent graphical display.

We have made an extensive review of research papers and Twitter-based services related to the information provided by Twitter, in addition to the definition of a theoretical framework that classifies this information. We have designed a system to digest data extracted and processed from Twitter in spanish. We determined three data generation strategies: detection of user's gender, categorization by content of tweets and geospatial display of tweets. The system also offers to external applications the possibility of accessing this generated data.

Lastly, we have built a web application as an example of how to display information extracted and processed by the system. The application interacts with real-time information in addition to displaying graphically stored data.
